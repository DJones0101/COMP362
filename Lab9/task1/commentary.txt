1. What is the page size that your operating system is using?
	
	My operating system is using pages of size 4096.

2. What is the valid scope for the first offset reference to the content of the file?
   
   The valid scope for the first offset reference must be a multiple of the page size.


3. Why does the program crash for some values of offset?

	The operating system can only detect that an entire page is being read not individual locations. The offsets must be algined with the pagesize boundary.

4. For what values of the offset, the program does not crash?

	The program will not crash for offset values that are between 4096 and 20060.
